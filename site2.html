        <p id="intro">A mysterious girl who is said to have saved a city from a dark vampire, once upon a time… At least, in appearance. Aside from the fact that she calls herself “Eltnum”, no one knows anything about this character. She suddenly appeared in the dark night, and then returned to darkness equally as fast, earning her the title of “Wanderer”. The Night of a city, which she claims to be her territory. It has become her mission to educate the young rookies in the strict ways of her industry.</p>

        <h3 class="style" id="aby">Abilities</h3>
        <p id="intro" >Eltnum's ability is the "EXS of Precision" (精密のEXS) called Analysis (アナライジス). In reality, it is actually a Magic Circuit (魔術回路「マジック・サーキット」) from her world, and is not truly an "EXS" due to the fact that she's not truly an In-Birth.

            Her weapon is a 5 kilometers long string called Etherite (エーテライト). She also possesses a gun called Replica Barrel (バレルレプリカ.
            
            She also possesses the powers of her alternate future self "Dust of Osiris" and can summon an entity known as the Tri Hermes Black Land.</p>
